# Data_Warehousing

## What is a data warehouse?

A data warehouse, or enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system to aggregate your data from multiple sources so it’s easy to access and analyze. Data warehouses typically store large amounts of historical data that can be queried by data engineers and business analysts for the purpose of business intelligence.

Instead of only having access to your data in individual sources, a data warehouse will funnel all your data from disparate sources (like transactional systems, relational databases, and operational databases) into one place. Once it’s in the warehouse, it’s accessible and usable across the business to get a holistic view of your customers. When your data is in one place, you can analyze related data from different sources, make better predictions, and ultimately make better business decisions.

## Data warehouse vs. database: how they're different

Databases and data warehouses are related but not the same.

A database is a way to record and access information from a single source. A database is often handling real-time data to support day-to-day business processes like transaction processing.

A data warehouse is a way to store historical information from multiple sources to allow you to analyze and report on related data (e.g., your sales transaction data, mobile app data, and CRM data). Unlike a database, the information isn’t updated in real-time and is better for data analysis of broader trends.



## What are the benefits of using a data warehouse?

Benefits of a data warehouse include the following:
  Informed decision making
  Consolidated data from many sources
  Historical data analysis
  Data quality, consistency, and accuracy
  Separation of analytics processing from transactional databases, which improves performance of both systems
